      <![CDATA[<p>Homepage: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lencerf.beancount">Beancount on Marketplace</a></p>

<p>Installation: <code>ext install beancount</code></p>

<p>Source Code: <a href="https://github.com/Lencerf/vscode-beancount">Lencerf/vscode-beancount</a></p>

<p>This is a simple VSCode extension for <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/">Beancount</a>, with the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax highlight,</li>
<li>Decimal point alignment,</li>
<li>Current time quick insertion,</li>
<li>Auto indent for a new posting record.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish to thank Chris for elaborating how to <a href="http://www.chrisstead.com/archives/1082/visual-studio-code-extensions-editing-the-document/">programmatically modify document contents</a> and Martin for sharing the Beancount <a href="https://github.com/draug3n/sublime-beancount/blob/master/beancount.tmLanguage">sytax file</a> with me.</p>

<p>I started making this extension after I tried VSCode for one day. Previously I really did not like Electron Apps, perhaps because of <a href="https://github.com/poooi/poi">POI</a> for KanColle. POI slowed down my Mac and caused the fan spin fast. Certainly, KanColle is based on Flash. So my Mac became even hotter. I also tried <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a> before. It also resulted in heats. Several days ago, after reading a post on VSCode, I downloaded it and found it is really good. At least, VSCode is fast and &ldquo;cool&rdquo;(literally) and its <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python">Python</a> extension made me surprised. Writing Python in VSCode is just as pleasant as writing C# in Visual Studio. I can not bear the response delay of MacVim plus YouCompleteMe any more. So I decide to switch to VSCode.</p>

<p>But I did not find any existing VSCode extensions for Beancount. Although the syntax of Beancount is very simple, I still want a function to automatically align decimal points of commodities. That&rsquo;s why I make this extension, although at the same time I much finish Quantum Mechanics 2 take-home midterm.</p>

<p>VSCode changes my opinions of Electron Apps, Javascript, and Microsoft. Actually now I think my bad impression on Javascript may just come from the fact that I have never written any Javascript codes by myself.</p>
